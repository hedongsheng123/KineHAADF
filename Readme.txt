KineHAADF aims to fastly generate the simulated HAADF-STEM images at atomic scale.  

'imasi2.m'is the main program. Run 'imasi2.m'to start the program.

The GUI may be ill-displayed. If so, you open 'imasi2.fig' in GUIDE and adjust the size and the postion of the windows.

Cite this paper 'Kinematic HAADF-STEM image simulation of small nanoparticles, Micron, Volume 74, July 2015, Pages 47-53
' if you find this program is helpful to your research work.

Good luck
